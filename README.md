# Twitch_leaderboard

This was a project for Free Code Camp. The specifications where to use Twitch API to pull up information about the 
Free Code Camp twitch channel.

I opted to make it more interesting and instead use AJAX with the Twitch API to query the top 10 streamers currently
streaming and provide their name, game being played, and number of viewers. I then ranked them by viewers and provided
links to their stream.
